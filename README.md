2. **Process Data**: After uploading, click "Process Data" to clean and transform the dataset.
3. **Select a Country and Boundary**: Use the dropdown menus to choose a country and an uncertainty boundary for analysis.
4. **Navigate Tabs**: Use the tab panel to switch between different visualizations:
   - "Country Trend" for mortality trends over time.
   - "Country Ranking" to track a countryâ€™s rank over time for a selected boundary.
   - "Rank Table" for detailed rankings in a specific year.
